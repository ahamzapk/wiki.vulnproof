# üéØ Mission Statement

Application security has become a global risk as organizations are finding it challenging to secure their software infrastructure.

The mission of this wiki is to `accelerate the transition to secure software development` by doing the following:

-   ‚≠ê Making secure development practices free and open for everyone to use and conveying them in such a way that is easy to understand and implement
-   ‚≠ê Creating awareness among software developers, so they take ownership of security
-   ‚≠ê Developing a community that supports one another to achieve this mission

<br/>

# üö¥ How to use

The security considerations listed in the checklists for each topic are merely recommendations, not mandatory requirements. When using a checklist for your project, keep in mind that it is not a set of strict rules to follow. The degree of significance for each item on the checklist is indicated by its assigned level of severity. Ultimately, it is up to you to determine what is most suitable for your project. If you need further explanation, don't hesitate to reach out.
