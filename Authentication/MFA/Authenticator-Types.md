# Authenticator Types

This section covers the different types of authentication factors that are available and their security considerations. Each type is divided into the following categories:

### üî¢ Single and Multi Factor OTP Devices

üî∂ **Definition:**

-   Single-factor One time Password (OTP) devices are physical devices that generate OTPs
-   Multi-factor OTP devices are like single-factor ones but require activation through either knowledge, physical characteristic, or a combination of both

üî∂ **Example:** OTP is displayed on the device and manually entered for transmission to the verifier, demonstrating possession and control. An OTP device can show, for instance, six characters at once

### üîë Single and Multi Factor Cryptographic Device and Software

üî∂ **Definitions:**

-   A single-factor cryptographic device is a hardware device that performs cryptographic operations using a protected cryptographic key(s) and provides the authenticator output via direct connection to the user endpoint
-   A multi-factor cryptographic device is similar to a single-factor cryptographic device but must be activated by either something you know, something you are or both
-   A single-factor cryptographic software is a cryptographic key stored on a disk or some other "soft" media. Authentication is accomplished by proving possession and control of the key
-   A Multi-factor cryptographic software is similar to single-factor cryptographic software but must be activated by either something you know, something you are or both

üî∂ **Examples:**

-   Single/Multi-factor cryptographic device:

    -   USB authenticators such as a YubiKey or Google Titan
    -   Smart cards with an embedded processor

-   Single/Multi-factor cryptographic software:

### üß¨ Biometric

üî∂ **Definition:** The use of biometrics in authentication includes both measurements of physical characteristics and behavioral characteristics of a user

üî∂ **Example:**

-   Facial recognition
-   Fingerprint scan
-   Iris scan
-   Typing cadence
