- An authenticated session must be started as soon as the user authenticates with all the factors.
- The session should in place until it is terminated 
- Session can be terminated due to a number of reasons: inactivity, logout event.
- The session can continue through a reauthentication event 

## Session Binding

- Session secret must be shared between the user's software (web browser or application) and the website the user is trying to access
- The session value from the user's software must be validated against a cryptographic mechanism 
- The session secret must be generated by the website that the user is trying to access, after a successful authentication event 
- The session secret must be generated by using approved random functions 
- The secret must have at least 64 bit entropy
- The session should be removed/erased when the user logs out
- The session secret should not be placed in insecure browser storage such as local storage since local storage is prone to cross site scripting attacks 
- The session secret must be shared with the user's software through an authenticated protected channel 
- The session shall time out after a limited time from 15 to 30 mins 
- The session should not be available in http after authentication
- Proper input validation must take place to ensure that no injection attacks occur


### Browser cookies

- Session cookies should have a secure flag on (HTTPS)
- Session should be accessible to minimum hostnames and paths
- Session cookies should be httponly 

### Access Tokens 

Access token, similar to OAuth, is used to allow an application to access a set of services on a subscriber's account's behalf following an authentication event. 

- An active OAuth token should not be used as a active session because OAuth tokens can be active even after the user has logged out


## Reauthentication 

- A authentication session must be continued as long as the user has a session secret that is Still valid and was issues after the authentication process 
- Session secret should be non-persistent meaning that they should not be valid once the application is restarted (browser/app closed and reopen) or reboot of the host device 
- Period reauthentication of the session should be performed to confirm the continued presence of the user 
- The session should not exceed the time limits for inactivity 
- Right before expiring, the time limit must be extended by prompting the user for reauthentication
