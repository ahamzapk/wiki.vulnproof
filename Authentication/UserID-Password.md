# User ID and Password Authentication

This checklist is designed to ensure the security of user authentication. It includes a series of steps and best practices for protecting user IDs and passwords and preventing unauthorized access to user accounts.

## üî® User Registration

The following two checklists should be considered for the identifiers that can be used as a User ID.

**Username**

## ü§î Forgot Credentials

When a user chooses forgot credentials, their identity can be verified through multiple ways:

-   Generate a PIN that can be sent to the user with the provided email. This PIN needs to be confirmed before a password reset is allowed
-   Create a token and pass it into the query string, create a limited session around that unique URL, and send it to the user's email
-   Recovery/Backup codes can also be used to give access when the user forgets their password

</br>

The following items must be considered for using PINS, URL tokens or Backup Codes.

**PIN**
